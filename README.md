# AdvancedAddons
Useful addons to Advanced Swords functionality

This mod adds enchantment upgrades of all vanilla enchantments, and makes them applicable to anything, not just swords.<br/>
It also adds:<br/>
• better durability tooltips to damageable items<br/>
• the Advanced Bow, which launches arrows faster and harder than the vanilla bow, and always shoots critical arrows,<br/>
• the Advanced Shield, which has more durability than the vanilla shield,<br/>
• Wooden, Stone, Nether Fortress, and Obsidian armors, each with special quirks and abilities, and<br/>
• a tracking dispenser that shoots at the nearest living entity within 32 blocks of it, rather than in only a single direction.

This repo is for the latest version of the mod, 1.9.4.
